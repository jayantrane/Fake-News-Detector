# Fake-News-Detector
Detection and prevention of propagation of fake news using blockchain in android application

A)We plan to prevent propogation of fake news using blockchain.
Whenever a user creates a message a new contract is created in the blockchain.Now people to whom the message is forwarded have three options namely-
1.Approve the message
2.Disapprove the message
3.Forward the message
By chossing any of the options above they stake some definite cryptocurrency. Thus on every approval ,disapproval or forward crytocuurency is added in the contract.

B) They are also provided with probability of fakeness of the article or message and link of other relevent article.
We summarize the given input using Natural Language Processing.The summarized content is then used to obtain relevant links from google.
Along with that we search for prominant words in the text and find related trending tweets.And using this information we apply an algorithm to obtain probablity of fakeness of the content.

To finalize the contract we have three conditions as follows:
1. The total count of either approval or disapproval should be greater than 80% of total votes.
2. The fakeness probability of content should be greater than 75%.
3. If both conditions are not met in certain period of time then the contract gets released.

People with right vote would be profitted by 25% margin and the wrong approvars or forwarders would be at loss. Thus preventing the propogation of fake content.Also the web scrapping tools would help people judge the article.

Thus, People would be more consious about what to share and what not to share!
